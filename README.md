# Movie-Recommendation-System

This is a Movie Recommendation System built using collaborative filtering techniques. It leverages user preferences, movie ratings, and genres to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system analyzes historical data to predict movies that a user might enjoy based on the patterns and interactions of similar users.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes user-item interaction matrix to predict movie ratings and suggest movies based on similar users' preferences.
- **Movie Database:** Contains a list of popular movies with associated genres and ratings, which is used to calculate similarity between users.
- **Interactive Interface:** The system includes an easy-to-use interface with a dropdown selection for genres and real-time movie recommendations.
- **Top Recommendations:** Displays a list of top-rated movies for each user, providing both title and average rating details.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For backend logic and data processing.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** Provides tools for collaborative filtering algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The development environment for building and testing the recommender system.

## How It Works
